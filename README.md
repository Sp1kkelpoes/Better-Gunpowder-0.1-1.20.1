Hello! Thank you for using our mod! It is highly appreciated,
This mod adds:
-an easier way to acquire gunpowder by crafting it
-Sulfur
-Potassiumnitrate
-extra fun addons including small fireworks and bombs
-Gunpowder golem

Since it may be boring and time consuming to get gunpowder (only creepers and chests) we have created this mod hoping to make minecraft more fun and easier!
How do you get Sulfur?
-Mines and near lava mostly in the desert biome between level -16 and 32
How do you get Potassiumnitrate?
-In the desert biome and near lava with a spawnrate almost as high as coal also between level -16 and 32.
Where do you find gunpowder golems?
-No, not in villages but in mines and in mountains (So basically near stone.)
